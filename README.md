## Building and running locally

This thing's intended more for code examples than as an actual distributable app, but you should still be able to run it just like you would any other React Native app. See [the React Native docs](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) for instructions.

The master branch contains only static data for demonstration purposes. If you'd like to see an example of real data fetching from an API, check out the `api-fetch-example` branch. (Note that it requires running the API server from [https://github.com/peterjmag/reading-list](https://github.com/peterjmag/reading-list).)
